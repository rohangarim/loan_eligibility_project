This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.

Feature engineering to improve model accuracy.

Machine learning model training and evaluation.

Predictive output to determine loan eligibility (Yes/No).
